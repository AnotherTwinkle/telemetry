# Telemetry

An android app that supports encrypted sms messaging betwen two numbers, with the added feature of location sharing upon request. (OK it's not really encrypted. The alphabet is just randomly shuffled with a mutual passkey acting as the seed.)

Each instance of the app can only pair up with one another instance. Multiple user support would probably be jolly but it's just too much efort. App is only developd to communicate with your significant other or whatever.

Also the code is really effed up and mostly dictated by LLMs :)
